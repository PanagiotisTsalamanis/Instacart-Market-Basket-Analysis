It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is based on Matplotlib (see below).\n\n* Matplotlib: a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms\n\nThe aforementioned Python packages are pre-installed for us, so we just need to load them.
